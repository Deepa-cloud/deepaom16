                            and administrators, your booking categories, packages, addons and bookings itself. It is important to
                            create an empty database before starting with <strong>Bookify</strong> installation. So let's create an empty database first.</p>
                            <br>
                            <div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Bookify</strong> is fully compatible with other SQL databases such
                            as PostgresSQL, SQlite and SQL Server. If you want to use them instead of MySQL, than make sure you create a database
                            accordingly. We are creating a MySQL database in our demo as it's most common.</div>
